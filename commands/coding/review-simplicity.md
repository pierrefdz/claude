# Simplicity Review

Analyze the codebase for over-engineering. Research code should be simple!

Flag:
- Over-abstraction (factories, deep hierarchies)
- Unnecessary complexity (metaprogramming, async when not needed)
- Long functions without clear structure
- Clever but unreadable code

Suggest simpler alternatives where possible.
