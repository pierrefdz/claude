# Comments Guidelines

## Principle
- Code should be self-documenting. If you need a comment to explain WHAT the code does, consider refactoring to make it clearer.
- Unacceptable Comments: repeat what code does, obvious comments ("increment counter"), comments instead of good naming

## Styles
- Start with a capital letter and end with a period

# Docstrings
- Use docstrings only when the function takes non-obvious arguments or has complex behavior
- Make them concise
